## Overview

### Description
This app uses the food API to generate recipes based on ingredients in your food.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Analyzes users food choices, and provides them with useful recipes.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted.
- **Scope:** First we would start with generating recipes with the provided ingredients and could potentially add the ability to connect with other users and see what recipes they are enjoying.
